# ProceduralGeneration3DMazes

This is a Unity 3D project which is allows the user to experiment with different types of maze generations for 3D mazes,
It also shows many properties of mazes and how solving them more efficently can be achieved via mechanisms such as flood fill which is demonstrated by the image below. There are many different types of mazes that could be generated that have different performance profiles and how the mazes look from the final result.
